# Variational Inference
***
Main idea: using a simpler distribution q(x) to approximate a complicate like p(x).   
***
To approximate the complicate distribution we need to:
1. Using KL-divergence to measure the difference between the distribution we want to approximate and the approximationg distribution.  
2. Minimizing the KL-divergence by reforming the equation and apply general mean-field equation on the ELBO.
